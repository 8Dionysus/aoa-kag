### Changed

- `AOA-K-0009` now covers a two-repo experimental spine pilot for `aoa-techniques` and `Tree-of-Sophia`
- `generated/federation_spine.json` and `generated/federation_spine.min.json` now publish the current source-owned ToS tiny-entry seam beside the existing `aoa-techniques` donor surfaces
- federation spine doctrine and public entry docs now describe the two-donor pilot as already consumable downstream while it remains experimental and non-authoritative
- `manifests/cross_source_node_projection.json` now declares explicit `projection_pairings` instead of leaving the current pilot pairing implicit in generator code
- reasoning handoff doctrine, example, and generated pack now name the counterpart consumer contract explicitly instead of leaving the first `counterpart_refs` consumer implicit
- counterpart consumer contract and tiny consumer bundle now carry an explicit federation exposure review ref while `AOA-K-0008` remains planned
- counterpart activation gates now treat federation exposure as review-closed for the planned posture rather than leaving it implicit
